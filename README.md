how to run?

1º download the repository

2º if necessary, extract the compressed file (https://www.meupositivo.com.br/doseujeito/dicas/como-abrir-descompactar-arquivos-rar-windows-10/)

3º inside the folder, click twice with the left button on "run"

3º note that a CMD will open, wait a few seconds until all dependencies are downloaded

4º now in CMD (the window that opened) look for "Now listening on: https:\\localhost:5001"

5º type this link in the previous step, and add /person, as in the example: https://localhost:5001/person (it may be necessary to give permissions when accessing the link. click on "advanced" and then click on "access anyway")

6º project is running.

7º to stop execution, press ctrl+c

Considerations:
this was my first CRUD in C# with just two days of study. I have never had experience with this programming language before. I have more experience in Java projects.

Thank you for viewing!
