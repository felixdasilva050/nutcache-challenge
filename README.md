nutcache challenge

how to run?

1ยบ download the repository

2ยบ if necessary, extract the compressed file (https://www.meupositivo.com.br/doseujeito/dicas/como-abrir-descompactar-arquivos-rar-windows-10/)

3ยบ inside the folder, click twice with the left button on "run"

Considerations:
this was my first CRUD in C# with just two days of study. I have never had experience with this programming language before. I have more experience in Java projects.

Thank you for viewing!
